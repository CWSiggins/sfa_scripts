# sfa_scripts
Python script that creates a smart save tool that can save a file based on inputs into a custom GUI or save incremently based on previous versions. The code is separated into a SceneFile obejct class that contains all of the logic for saving and a SmartSaveUI object class that contains all of the code that sets up the custom User Interface.
Another Python script that scatters instances of an object onto the vertices of another along with additional optional modifiers. This script uses the same design patter as the SmartSave script.
